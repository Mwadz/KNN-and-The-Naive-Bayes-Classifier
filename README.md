# KNN-and-The-Naive-Bayes-Classifier
Applying supervised learning algorithms such as regression, decision trees, KNN, SVM, naive Bayes, random forests to solving business problems.

## Proceedure Description
<br>

<b>A) K Nearest Neighbour</b>
* I Randomly partitioned each dataset into two parts i.e 80 - 20  sets.
* Dataset 1 didn't have the label for the test set so I used the train set to create train and test data (i.e. splitting further)
* I then proceeded to perform K-nearest neighbor classification.

<b>B) Naive Bayes Classifier</b>
* Performed classification of the testing set samples using NBC .
* Computed the accuracy (percentage of correct classification).
* Reported the confusion matrix of each classifier.
* Repeated step 2 of KNN to step 1 of NBC twice, each time splitting the datasets differently i.e. 70-30, 60-40
* Noteed the outcomes of your modeling.

I then suggested and applied one optimization technique and provided further recommendations to improve both classifiers.
